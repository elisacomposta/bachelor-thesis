This is the thesis I wrote for my Bachelor's Degree in _Computer, Communication and Electronic Engineering_ at the University of Trento, in 2022. <br>
It focuses on Soft Robot evolution, applying Reinforcement Learning and Quality Diversity algorithms to optimize the controller and the morphology, respectively.

The code is available in [this repo](https://github.com/elisacomposta/soft-robot-evolution.git).
